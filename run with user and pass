ansible all -m ping -s -k -u vagrant
Let's cover these commands:

all - Use all defined servers from the inventory file
-m ping - Use the "ping" module, which simply runs the ping command and returns the results
-s - Use "sudo" to run the commands
-k - Ask for a password rather than use key-based authentication
-u vagrant - Log into servers using user vagrant
